# notes
A place where I keep my notes and questions for the public to read and answer.

## What are those notes?
Notes is basically a place for me to store notes and thoughts, as well as questions, on certain subjects I'm interested in with design and code.

## Questions
In each subject, there's a `QUESTIONS.md` file. If you have an answer for any of them, by all means add the answer to `ANSWERS.md` using a pull request!

## Credit
As inspired by [@charlotteis's](https://github.com/Charlotteis) [Notes repository.](https://github.com/Charlotteis/notes) You should check their repo out, it's pretty cool and informative!
